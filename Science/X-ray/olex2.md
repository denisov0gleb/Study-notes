## Usage ##
[Table of Content](#table-of-content)

Open *.res*, *.ins*, *.cif* files.


## CIF ##
[Table of Content](#table-of-content)

`twin` - search for twinning in centrosymentrical groups.

`basf 0.5` - **???**

`isor value` - **???** *value* >= 0.01

`eadp` - **???** equal anis **???**

`fvar` - link two or more atoms through a free variable (usually the chemical occupancy for different parts).

`omit -4 value` - omit any reflections with 2theta more than **value**.


## Commands ##
[Table of Content](#table-of-content)

### Bonding information ###

`htab` - generate *.lst* file with main information + the D...A distance in the end (not
included in *cif* file).

`pipi` - print the distance between centers of the aromatic rings (centroid-to-centroid distance).

`esd` - print the distance between two selected atoms, including the error.


### Molecule growing ###

`pack #` - change packing parameter

`compaq` - moves all atoms or fragments of the asymmetric unit as close to each other as possible.


### Names ###

`name type` - rename selected to the *type*

`name type1 type2` - rename *type1* to *type2*

`name -s=suffix` - rename selected suffixes.

`Legend` - show/hide legend


### Labels ###

`showp value` - show only requested parts

`labels` - show/hide labels

| `labels -X` | Description        |
| ---         | ---                |
| -p          | Parts              |
| -a          | Afixes             |
| -h          | Hydrogens          |
| -co         | Chemical occupancy |
| -v          | Free variables     |



### Atom selection ###

`envi r=2.7 atom` - print a list of atoms within a sphere of radius **r** around the atom (named or selected).

`-h` - including hydrogens

`-q` - including Q-peaks


### Cell and symmetry ###

`cell` - show/hide cell


## Images ##
[Table of Content](#table-of-content)

`save model name` - generate *.oxm* (*name.oxm*) file for image storage


## Keybindings ##

| **\<F3\>** | show/hide labels                                                 |
| **Ctrl+R** | refine structure                                                 |
| **Ctrl+H** | toggle between show H, show H with internal h-bonds, hide H.     |
| **Ctrl+T** | toggle between show structure only, structure + text, only text. |
